        "1.\t**For a novel application or to avoid starting from scratch:** As a scientist you may be faced with a daunting project that seems like you have to build everything from scratch, or your use case may be wildly different from the intended use of the distribution. Best practices are to avoid repeating code unecessarily and take advantage of the hard work that others have done before you. As Newton said: \"If I have seen further it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants\". You'll need to take care to avoid plaigarism or violating licenses but for one-time academic uses there are almost always ways to do this appropriately. \n",
        "1.\t**Extend the useability:** Sometimes the distribution just isn't intended for your use case. Maybe it requires real-valued data but you want to use complex numbers. Maybe your matrices are too large, or it just doesn't use the right algorithm at a key point, or you need to substitute one function for another. In these cases don't forget to submit a [feature request](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). \n",
        "1.\t**Fix a \"bug\":** If the distribution has a bug, but you need to use it and can't find solutions in forums and can't wait for a fix (after starting an issue) it makes sense to modify the files where the issue exists. Most people in this situation will also submit their problem and solution to the distribution's [bug tracker](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). \n",
        "1.\t**Develop a deeper understanding of the algorithm and learn best coding practices:** As a scientist in 2019 you probably have limited training in algorithms and how to code professionally. Few of our elder's needed these skills. If you find yourself frequently using particular functions or libraries, it would be wise for you to understand them well enough to be creative and avoid hidden pit-falls.  Furthermore, we scientists write awful code. Take advantage of the opportunity to see the habits and tricks python (or other) community uses. \n",
        "\n",
        "## What are the problems?\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\t**Breaking things:** If you do this incorrectly, your modifications may be lost at the next update, or that new update or other distribution may become incompatible with your modified distribution, other people may not be able to use your work, or if your computing resources are shared, you may destroy functionality for your collegues. \n",
        "2.\t**Losing track of what’s been modified:** If you do this wrong you may forget you made a change and get unexpected behavior in the future. You may forget what modifications you made and not be able to restore the previous function. \n",
        "3.\t**Violating licenses:** We cannot and do not offer legal advice, only speculation and hear-say from the internet. It is often (usually?) the case that you cannot distribute modified versions of distributions. This means you can't put it in a public github or link to it on a website. When sharing *parts* of a distribution you should always explicitly credit the original distribution or better yet the authors, and mark your changes so that it is obvious. Read [the license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_license) and be aware of what you need to do. As a scientist doing non-commercial research you are probably permitted to use it and to share it with colleagues via personal communition. This is not legal advice.\n",

        "Since we showed you here the python library's files are, you could always just go and tweak those. People usually do this because they encountered an unsolved bug or unmet need and didn't feel like they had the time to google the proper method, or because they couldn't think of a useful google search phrase and gave up looking. This is asking for trouble. If you do this, always keep track of what you did and comeback later to do it correctly. \n",

        "A better version of this hack is to do this in a virtual environment, you will still break updates within that virtual environment and it may be a headache to use your code outside the environment (e.g. sharing it). However, some distributions make it hard to install an editable version. So making your tweaks in a virtual environment lets you take the time to figure out what changes are required while limiting the broken software to the virtual environment. Then you can go back and copy out just the portions you figured out you need to change. Remember to delete all traces of the virtual environment when you are done using it (or lock it in an archive for posterity). "
